# catching-spam-phishing-email
Reads through an email (.txt in this case) and looks for keywords and misspelled words to check for possibly phishing or scam attempts.

The keywords for spam and phishing are rated for each word and adds them up while reading the through the email. It then checks to see the "value" of the email to see if exceeds the threshold for it to be considered spam or phishing. 
This is after a few months of coding in C++.
